My personal [GKISS](https://github.com/gkisslinux/grepo) repository.

Main highlights so far:

- melonDS
- chrony
- openjdk11-hotspot-bin

On the "eventually" list, not done yet:

- MultiMC (annoying path stuff, will figure it out)
- wine (lots of dependencies; of these libunwind is done)

On the "maybe" list, may never be done:

- steam (lots of dependencies; of these xterm is done)
